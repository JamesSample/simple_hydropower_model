    "# Simulating climate change on run-of-river hydropower\n",
    "\n",
    "This repo contains basic Python code for estimating the potential impacts of climate change on Scotland's run-of-river hydropower potential. The code makes use of the following publically available datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[Future Flows catchment level summaries](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/f3723162-4fed-4d9d-92c6-dd17412fa37b)** <br><br>\n",
    "The Future Flows (FF) project used gridded output from the Met Office's HadRM3 Regional Climate Model (RCM) to estimate changing river flows for around 280 catchments across the UK. 11 different simulations from the RCM (all based on A1B emissions) were first bias-corrected and downscaled to 1 km resolution. These simulations were then used to drive up to three hydrological models in each catchment, resulting in between 11 and 33 flow time series per site. The simulations run from 1951 to 2098 and the range of output gives a broad indication of the range of uncertainty in flows under the assumptions of the medium (A1B) emissions scenario and the HadRM3 climate model. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **[Historic flow data from the National River Flow Archive (NRFA)](http://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/search)**<br><br>\n",
    "Observed data for some (148) of the FF catchments can be downloaded from the NFRA. A summary of the FF sites and whether observed data is easily available is given in [NRFA_FF_Stations.csv](https://github.com/JamesSample/simple_hydropower_model/blob/master/NRFA_FF_Stations.csv). <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The observed datasets provide an important check on the quality of the FF output. For many catchments, the FF simulations for historic periods are *not* a close match for the observed data, suggesting they are not suitable for investigating future flows. In catchments where FF model perfromance is better, we may have some justification for using the data to simulate future hydropower, although this still involves making some fairly sweeping assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Estimating hydropower potential\n",
    "\n",
    "Many guidance documents recommend that *preliminary* hydropower assessments are based on **Flow Duration Curves (FDCs)** derived from daily flow data. The code here assumed a basic, **single turbine design** and some very coarse efficiency estimates (different turbine designs are ignored, for example). This is because, at regional scale, there is still large uncertainty in both the magnitude direction future climate change, so a detailed consideration of plant design specifications is unwarranted. Given a flow time series with daily resolution, the code here estimates hydropower potential in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the FDC using standard methods. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assume the site has a fixed head, $H$, and that turbine size is determined by selecting a particular exceedance percentage, $P_{opt}$ (which broadly represents the proportion of the time that a turbine is expected to run at full capacity). Smaller values of $P_{opt}$ represent higher design flows and bigger turbines, running at full capacity for a smaller proportion of the time. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  The choice of $P_{opt}$ is not obvious and has a large effect on the scheme power output. It is therefore necessary to consider a range of values for $P_opt$, which involves repeating the calculations below many times. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \tUsing $P_{opt}$ and the FDC, read off the associated flow rate ($Q_{opt}$) and estimate the turbine capacity using the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$C = \\rho g Q H \\frac{E}{100}$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  where $C$ is the turbine capacity ($W$), $\\rho$ is the density of water ($kg/m^3$), Q is the flow rate ($m^3/s$), $H$ is the head ($m$) and $E$ is the overall plant efficiency factor (%). <br><br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. At flows greater than or equal to $Q_{opt}$, the turbine will function at its rated peak capacity, C. At flows below this, the turbine will function at reduced output down to some lower threshold, $Q_{min}$, where power generation stops. $Q_{min}$, is usually approximated as a percentage (e.g. 30%) of $Q_{opt}$. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Most schemes have a **“hands-off-flow” (HOF)** which must be left in the river at all times and which therefore cannot be diverted into a penstock. SEPA’s rules for the HOF are quite complicated, but it’s typically set at around the 90-95th exceedance percentile. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The HOF must always be left in the stream, so power generation cannot begin until the flow rate in the river reaches ($HOF + Q_{min}$). Power output will then increase until the flow reaches ($HOF + Q_{opt}$), after which the turbine operates at maximum capacity and any additional flow bypasses the installation. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The area under a daily FDC (integrated along the x-axis from 0 to 1; if using percentages you need to divide by 100) gives the mean daily flow. The blue area on the figure below is the equivalent of the mean daily flow that would be available to the hydro scheme, $Q_{avail}$. The actual power output, $C_{act}$, can therefore be estimated by substituting this value into the equation in 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![FDC](https://github.com/JamesSample/simple_hydropower_model/blob/master/Images/FDC_Example.png?raw=true \"FDC\")\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In addition to the above, the model includes an additional parameter describing the amount of water available to the scheme for flows *above* the HOF. Environmental regulations sometimes only allow schemes to take e.g. 50% of stream flow above the HOF. This is the same as the approach of [Carless & Whitehead (2013)](http://hr.iwaponline.com/content/44/3/495). <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The **annual energy output** from the installation can be estimated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$E = \\frac{365 \\times 24 \\times C_{act}}{1000}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  where $C_{act}$ is in $W$ and $E$ is in $kWh$. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The **load factor** for the installation can also be calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$L = \\frac{C_{act}}{C} \\times 100\\%$$ <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Note that there are some edge cases that need to be accounted for:\n",
    "  * $P_{opt} = min(P_{opt}, P_{HOF})$ <br><br>\n",
    "  * $(Q_{opt} + Q_{HOF})$ must be less than the maximum flow recorded in the dataset. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The code provided performs these calculations for all the observed and simulated datasets in each catchment. Options are provided for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Scaling the FF data according to catchment area,\n",
    "  * Selecting different baseline and future time periods, and \n",
    "  * Considering either annual or seasonal power generation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## 2. User defined options\n",
    "\n",
    "The user is required to supply the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **obs_fold**. A folder containing observed data for the stations of interest downloaded from the NRFA. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ff_fold**. A folder containing the FF timeseries for the catchment of interest. Note that each catchment may be associated with up to three files (=33 time series), depending on the number of hydrological models applied for each site. <br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Head**. The plant \"head\" in $m$. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **catch_area**. The catchment area for the proposed scheme. The code uses simple area-scaling to estimate flows for this area based on the simulated dataset and the overall catchment area. Such estimates are clearly very rough, especially for large, heterogeneous catchments. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **plant_eff_factor**. The overall efficiency (%) of the plant (turbine and generator). As a guide, HEC says ~85%, while british-hydro.org says ~70%. <br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3. Output\n",
    "\n",
    "For each site, the script produces a 5-page PDF, saved to **out_fold**. Each page includes information for a season, plus a fifth page showing overall annual changes. An example of the **summer** output for the **Allan Water at Kinbuck** is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top half of the page shows FDCs based on the observed and FF datasets. The blue dashed line shows the actual FDC based on observed data between 1961 and 1990. The solid black line show the FF simulated median for the same period, with grey shading to represent the modelled **90% uncertainty interval**. The FF project only applied 1 hydrological model in this catchment, so the confidence interval reflects uncertianty in the 11 different climate simulations used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the solid black and dashed blue lines suggests that the FF model does a reasonable job of simulating high flows, but consistently overestimates low flows. The results for this therefore need to be interpreted with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solid red line shows the median FF simulation for the future period (in this case 2041 to 2070), with the red shading agains showing the 90% uncertainty interval based on the climate data used. Relative to the FF baseline, it is clear that flows are expected to decrease, but the range of ucnertainty is also substantially broader.\n",

    "\n",
    "The lower half of each page shows the energy output and load factors expected for turbines of different capacities, both now and in the future. These plots can therefore be used to investigate how power output from a turbine of a given might change in the future (both annually and seasonally), as well as indicating whether a different turbine specification may be more appropriate in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "As a very simple evaluation, the code has been tested against data from the well-studied Plynlimon catchment in the upper Severn Valley. [Carless & Whitehead (2013)](http://hr.iwaponline.com/content/44/3/495) undertook a more detailed site-specific study of the hydropower potential of this catchment, which provides a good opportunity to test the broader methodology presented here. Using a baseline period of 1985 to 2008, Carless & Whitehead report a mean daily flow $0.58 \\; m^3/s$ and identify a $99 kW$ turbine as being appropriate for the site. They predict $282 MWh$ of energy per year with an average load factor of $33\\%$. Looking at their Fig. 8, the seasonal breakdown was something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Season | Energy output (MWh) |\n",
    "|:------:|--------------------:|\n",
    "| Spring |                  55 |\n",
    "| Summer |                  48 |\n",
    "| Autumn |                  84 |\n",
    "| Winter |                  95 |\n",
    "| Annual |                 282 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the code here for this location with approximately the same parameters as Carless and Whitehead, I estimate a ~99 kW turbine would be a reasonable choice and that it would produce the following outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Season | Energy output (MWh) | Load factor(%) |\n",
    "|:------:|--------------------:|---------------:|\n",
    "| Spring |                  54 |             26 |\n",
    "| Summer |                  44 |             20 |\n",
    "| Autumn |                  78 |             36 |\n",
    "| Winter |                  90 |             42 |\n",
    "| Annual |                 266 |             31 |\n",
    "\n",
    "These results seem very close to those already published, especially considering that Carless and Whitehead used monthly FDCs, which have a tendency to overestimate power generation potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the PDF output suggests that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For the observed baseline, any turbine capacity between about 90 and 130 kW would be a reasonable choice, giving annual capacity factors of between about 25 and 35%.  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Under 2050s climate, a 99 kW turbine would likely generate marginally less energy annually that it would under current conditions (256 MWh for future versus 264 MWh for FF baseline), but this difference is likely negligible.  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* During the spring, and particularly during the summer, the 2050s energy output would be significantly reduced compared to the baseline. During the summer, a 99 kW turbine would rarely – if ever – be operating at full capacity and summer energy output would likely drop from around 40-45 MWh per year to 20-30. Load factors during this period would likely fall below 20%.  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Energy output in the autumn may also be slightly reduced, although not by much. For a 99 kW turbine, the FF baseline gives 83 MWh and a load factor of 38%, compared to 78 MWh and 36% for the future scenario. The FDCs suggest that peak flows may increase during this season, but that medium to low flows may decrease i.e. overall autumn flows become more variable. There is potential for larger turbines (e.g. up to 200 kW) to take advantage of these higher flows, but as such high flow events are still quite rare, the associated capacity factors are very low and such turbines would probably not be economically feasible. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* During the winter there is a general increase in flows at all percentiles of the FDC, meaning that more energy is available for power generation. The data suggest that a ~99 kW turbine installed under baseline conditions would likely produce slightly more energy in the future (83 MWh and 39% for the FF baseline versus 91 MWh and 43% for the future). These gains become larger for larger turbines: for example, a 160 kW installation produces 98 MWh at 29% capacity under the FF baseline, but 110 MWh at 32% in the 2050s. These winter gains go some way to offsetting the summer losses, which is why the annual change is fairly small. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overall, it seems likely that power generation potential will not change much at Plynlimon by the 2050s: in annual terms, the energy output of a turbine sized using historic data is likely to remain approximately the same in the future. It is possible that the optimum turbine size will increase marginally under future conditions. However, the FF data does not make a clear case for oversizing turbines, as suggested by Carless and Whitehead. Oversizing does result in slightly larger gains in winter production, and also very marginally reduces the losses during the autumn. However, spring and summer production suffers even more and load factors during these months with big turbines would likely be well below 20%. It therefore seems unlikely that oversizing turbines would be cost effective, given the additional equipment and installations costs."
