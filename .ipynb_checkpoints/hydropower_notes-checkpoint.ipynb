    "# Simulating climate change on run-of-river hydropower\n",
    "\n",
    "This repo contains basic Python code for estimating the potential impacts of climate change on Scotland's run-of-river hydropower potential. The code makes use of the following publically available datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[Future Flows catchment level summaries](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/f3723162-4fed-4d9d-92c6-dd17412fa37b)** <br><br>\n",
    "The Future Flows (FF) project used gridded output from the Met Office's HadRM3 Regional Climate Model (RCM) to estimate changing river flows for around 280 catchments across the UK. 11 different simulations from the RCM (all based on A1B emissions) were first bias-corrected and downscaled to 1 km resolution. These simulations were then used to drive up to three hydrological models in each catchment, resulting in between 11 and 33 flow time series per site. The simulations run from 1951 to 2098 and the range of output gives a broad indication of the range of uncertainty in flows under the assumptions of the medium (A1B) emissions scenario and the HadRM3 climate model. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **[Historic flow data from the National River Flow Archive (NRFA)](http://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/search)**<br><br>\n",
    "Observed data for some (148) of the FF catchments can be downloaded from the NFRA. A summary of the FF sites and whether observed data is easily available is given in [NRFA_FF_Stations.csv](https://github.com/JamesSample/simple_hydropower_model/blob/master/NRFA_FF_Stations.csv). <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The observed datasets provide an important check on the quality of the FF output. For many catchments, the FF simulations for historic periods are *not* a close match for the observed data, suggesting they are not suitable for investigating future flows. In catchments where FF model perfromance is better, we may have some justification for using the data to simulate future hydropower, although this still involves making some fairly sweeping assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Estimating hydropower potential\n",
    "\n",
    "Many guidance documents recommend that *preliminary* hydropower assessments are based on **Flow Duration Curves (FDCs)** derived from daily flow data. Given a flow time series with daily resolution, the code here estimates hydropower potential in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the FDC using standard methods. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assume the site has a fixed head, $H$, and that turbine size is determined by selecting a particular exceedance percentage, $P_{opt}$ (which broadly represents the proportion of the time that a turbine is expected to run at full capacity). Smaller values of $P_{opt}$ represent higher design flows and bigger turbines, running at full capacity for a smaller proportion of the time. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  The choice of $P_{opt}$ is not obvious and has a large effect on the scheme power output. It is therefore necessary to consider a range of values for $P_opt$, which involves repeating the calculations below many times. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \tUsing $P_{opt}$ and the FDC, read off the associated flow rate ($Q_{opt}$) and estimate the turbine capacity using the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$C = \\rho g Q H \\frac{E}{100}$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  where $C$ is the turbine capacity ($W$), $\\rho$ is the density of water ($kg/m^3$), Q is the flow rate ($m^3/s$), $H$ is the head ($m$) and $E$ is the overall plant efficiency factor (%). <br><br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. At flows greater than or equal to $Q_{opt}$, the turbine will function at its rated peak capacity, C. At flows below this, the turbine will function at reduced output down to some lower threshold, $Q_{min}$, where power generation stops. $Q_{min}$, is usually approximated as a percentage (e.g. 30%) of $Q_{opt}$. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Most schemes have a **“hands-off-flow” (HOF)** which must be left in the river at all times and which therefore cannot be diverted into a penstock. SEPA’s rules for the HOF are quite complicated, but it’s typically set at around the 90-95th exceedance percentile. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The HOF must always be left in the stream, so power generation cannot begin until the flow rate in the river reaches ($HOF + Q_{min}$). Power output will then increase until the flow reaches ($HOF + Q_{opt}$), after which the turbine operates at maximum capacity and any additional flow bypasses the installation. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The area under a daily FDC (integrated along the x-axis from 0 to 1; if using percentages you need to divide by 100) gives the mean daily flow. The blue area on the figure below is the equivalent of the mean daily flow that would be available to the hydro scheme, $Q_{avail}$. The actual power output, $C_{act}$, can therefore be estimated by substituting this value into the equation in 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![FDC](https://github.com/JamesSample/simple_hydropower_model/blob/master/Images/FDC_Example.png?raw=true \"FDC\")\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In addition to the above, the model includes an additional parameter describing the amount of water available to the scheme for flows *above* the HOF. Environmental regulations sometimes only allow schemes to take e.g. 50% of stream flow above the HOF. This is the same as the approach of [Carless & Whitehead (2013)](http://hr.iwaponline.com/content/44/3/495). <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The **annual energy output** from the installation can be estimated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$E = \\frac{365 \\times 24 \\times C_{act}}{1000}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  where $C_{act}$ is in $W$ and $E$ is in $kWh$. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The **load factor** for the installation can also be calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$L = \\frac{C_{act}}{C} \\times 100\\%$$ <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Note that there are some edge cases that need to be accounted for:\n",
    "  * $P_{opt} = min(P_{opt}, P_{HOF})$ <br><br>\n",
    "  * $(Q_{opt} + Q_{HOF})$ must be less than the maximum flow recorded in the dataset. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The code provided performs these calculations for all the observed and simulated datasets in each catchment. Options are provided for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Scaling the FF data according to catchment area,\n",
    "  * Selecting different baseline and future time periods, and \n",
    "  * Considering either annual or seasonal power generation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The user is required to supply the following information:\n",
